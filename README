Geometry Genocide v1.0

2D Arcade Game inspired by Geometry Wars. 

Design

This game is written in python using the pygame (pygame.org) library for graphics and sound management.

This project was developed for a 1st year college assignment. The initial design overused inheritence and operator overloading being the cool thing at the time. I recently found this project sitting in some old folders and decided to put it online, after which I decided to polish some aspects of the games design to perform better on low end machines such as netbooks.
